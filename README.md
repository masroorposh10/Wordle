# Wordle Game

The Wordle Game is a fun and interactive word-guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It challenges players to guess a target word by providing feedback on the correctness of their guesses. This README provides an overview of the game and instructions for getting started.

#Game Rules
The game selects a random target word, typically of five letters.
The player enters their guess into the input field and submits it.
The game provides feedback on the correctness of the guess:
Correct letters in the correct positions are indicated with a colored square.
Correct letters in incorrect positions are indicated with a colored circle.
Incorrect letters are left blank.
The player continues guessing until they either guess the target word correctly or run out of attempts.
The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays a win/lose message accordingly.
Technologies Used
The Wordle Game is built using the following technologies:

HTML: The structure of the game interface is created using HTML5 markup.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets are used to style the game elements and provide an engaging user interface.
JavaScript: The game logic and interactivity are implemented using JavaScript.
Getting Started
To play the Wordle Game locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone [repository-url]

How to Play
Once the game is loaded, you will see an input field to enter your guesses.
Guess a five-letter word by typing it into the input field and pressing the Enter key or clicking the Submit button.
The game will provide feedback on your guess:
A colored square indicates a correct letter in the correct position.
A colored circle indicates a correct letter in the wrong position.
An empty space indicates an incorrect letter.
Use the feedback to refine your guesses and continue guessing until you guess the target word correctly or run out of attempts.
The game will display a win/lose message based on the outcome of your attempts.

Word List: Modify the list of target words in the JavaScript code to change the words that players have to guess. You can add, remove, or modify words to suit your preferences.
UI Design: Adjust the CSS styles to change the visual appearance of the game, including colors, fonts, and layout.
Game Rules: Customize the game rules, such as the number of attempts allowed, the length of the target word, or the feedback symbols used.
